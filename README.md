# Genuary 2023

[Live Website](https://lorismat-genuary2023.vercel.app/)  

## About the code

The website is a `Nuxt` application.  
All my prompts are made with Three.js and/or glsl and are available in this repository.  
All prompts are `vue` components using `Three.js` accessible in `components/Canvas/CanvasX.vue`.  
Some of the prompts run shaders, accessible in `assets/glsl/X`, `X` being the prompt day.  

You can use any part of the code but please let me know if you do! And leave the credits where I left them, if any.
